# Last Outpost

# Description
Last Outpost is a Tower Defense game being developed in the Topics in Computing course. The project aims to create a game from scratch using C++ and technologies like SDL2, without relying on pre-made engines. The game will feature a progression system for each unit and increasing difficulty with each stage, introducing new enemies and different terrains.
